Software for calculating iES and Rsb statistics.
following Tang, Thornton & Stoneking, PloS Biology 2007.
verion 20200615

Usage:
Tang_stats [genotype filename (one chrom)] [number of SNPs] [number of indiv] [threshold value (eg=0.1)] [seed (eg=123456)] [number pops] [size pop1] [size pop2] ... [size popN] [name_pop1] ... [name_popN]

Output file is automatically generated with the input filename plus '_Results_Tang.txt'

Note: The analysis uses unphased data. That is, the results obtained using the unphosed data are based on the observed homozygosity per individual. The results can be very different that using haplotypes (phased data), which uses the expected homozygosity assuming panmixia (you can uses the R library "rehh" to perform analysis with phased data).
